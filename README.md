# Cs-Gym-JSBIN
Sign into a gym assessed task 

I have written a basic version of the task in basic python with no gui, I have begun to work on the task using tkinter as a gui however tkinter isn't great as a gui and I would like to become proficient in HTML, CSS and Js to help with the front end of web development. Therefore I have begun to attempt to write the task as a website using Jsbin.
